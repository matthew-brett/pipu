pipu - a Python package installer based on pip
==============================================

Pipu is a drop in replacement for Pip - the Python Package Installer.

It is designed to act exactly as Pip does with a single exception - it will
not try and force you into using virtualenvs if you are working on a Python
distribution like Homebrew or Gentoo.

See the `Pip documentation <https://pip.matthew-brett.io>`_ for usage and
other instructions.   To use `pipu` just use `pipu` instead of `pip`
throughout.

We will release updates regularly, with a new version every 3 months, closely
following Pip's own release schedule.

If you have an issue with Pipu, please first try:
